# Employee Turnover Prediction

### This project is based on machine learning and focuses on these four learning objectives:

1. Apply __decision trees__ and __random forests__ with __scikit-learn__ to classification problems.
2. Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots.
3. Tune model hyperparamters to improve classification accuracy.
4. Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using widgets.

__This was my first attempt towards a Data Science Project.__
